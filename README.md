# Microservices Project with Docker Containers

This repository contains a microservices project implemented using Docker containers. The project consists of three web API services that use different database servers: MS-SQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main sections:

1. **Customer Section:**
   - `customerdb`: MS-SQL database container.
   - `customerwebapis`: Web API container for customer-related functionality.

2. **Product Section:**
   - `productdb`: MySQL database container.
   - `productwebapis`: Web API container for product-related functionality.

3. **Order Section:**
   - `orderdb`: MongoDB container.
   - `orderwebapis`: Web API container for order-related functionality.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will build and start all the containers in the background.

4. Access the web APIs using the following URLs:

   - Customer Web API: http://localhost:8002
   - Product Web API: http://localhost:8005
   - Order Web API: http://localhost:8007

## Database Configuration

Each web API service is configured to connect to its respective database container. Here are the database details:

- **Customer Database:**
  - Host: `customerdb`
  - Database Name: `dms_customer`
  - Username: `sa`
  - Password: `password@12345#`

- **Product Database:**
  - Host: `productdb`
  - Database Name: `dms_product`
  - Username: `root`
  - Password: `password@12345#`

- **Order Database:**
  - Host: `orderdb`
  - Database Name: `dms_order`

## Stopping the Containers

To stop the containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
